================ AGILE DEVELOPMENT ================

Relating to or denoting a method of project managment, used especially for software development, that is 
characterized by the division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans.

===================================================

* This refers to the methodollogy of splitting up large tasks into small sections, that are then completed one at a time
  in what is known as a "sprint". These time periods usually last around 3 to 4 weeks.

* After each sprint is complete, you are able to deliver working software. By having working software, you can then
  reassess the plan and to better complete the upcoming sprint and in the long-term, the project as a whole.

* When using the Agile methodollogy, you should start by making a small, functioning program that emcompasses your final projects
  goals, but make it barebones. Then you breakup all the features into tasks, and bust them out one at a time. This means that
  after every sprint, you will be adding a working feature, to an already working software base, therefore making it more advanced
  and closer to the desired outcome.
